This installation guide differs from the original one due to the customization of some items. This manual is intended for Windows OS.  
1. You should install Python on your local machine ([https://www.python.org/downloads/]). Code was written on Python2, but I compiled it using Python3.  
2. Check where is your home directory (run in unix terminal python -c "import os; print(os.getenv('HOME'))"). I recommend that you use GitBash.  
3. Go to home directory and clone repository https://github.com/jon-jacky/PyModel.git .  
4. Go to directory Pymodel and run : python setup.py , then go on bin folder and run pymodel_paths_mydocs.bat.
5. Any additional python libs aren't required so I skipped file requirements.txt.
6. To test some cases go to directory samples/Stack(for example) and run tpath.bat. You should run that cmd in every new sample.
7.
